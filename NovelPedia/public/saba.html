    <h1><a name="The Family">The Family</a></h1>
    <p>I n a town of Lahore, a town specially allocated for lower middle class
        families. Where people live a struggling life to fulfill their needs. When
        the sun arises, people came out of home and go to their respective work,
        a new life begins with some new ambitions and hope. Their is the
        apartment near the only mosque of the town, where I lived with my
        parents and three siblings, three sisters and I the only brother, My name
        is Hamid and I am the youngest in the family. My father Muhammad
        Iqbal (Baba Jan) was very orthodox & staunch, and he believes that he
        only needs to invest all his money & attention on his one & only son that
        was on me. Jameela is eldest sister of mine,then Saba and then Ayesha.
        Saba Baji was always curious about our family’s living where every
        single day we get to hear how hard Baba Jan was working hard to keep
        the family afloat. Jameela Baji was learning Sewing and Stitching in an
        Institute while Saba baji had completed her college with good grades but
        didn’t continue her education due to the severe financial condition of the
        family and Saba baji was completing her intermediate from Allama Iqbal
        Medical College, while I was in the 10th standard.</p>

        <h1><a name="Her Life">Her life</a></h1>
        <p>S aba Baji had a passion for writing & how she found repose when she
            filled the papers with her thoughts. Ignoring the objection of our family,
            Saba baji thinks she ain’t doing anything wrong if she is sharing her
            thought process with others through her stories. The only little support
            Saba Baji had was of her college friend.The background to which we
            belong to, definitely doesn’t allow girls to fulfil their wishes, no matter
            how harmless they might be & what really creates a mountain of
            problems for a girl is when her story will be published in a digest.That
            gives rouse to all sorts of opinions that are not in Saba Baji’s favour but
            despite seeing everything against her, Saba Baji remains persistent to
            pursue her dream of becoming a writer because the positive response
            she gets from the readers boosts the confidence in her that she can
            entertain people through her work. Saba Baji deals with the harsh reality
            of her life by turning her reality into fictional situations that her characters
            are facing in her stories & that’s how she uses her circumstances as an
            inspiration for her stories because she takes her imaginary world as a
            sweet escape from what’s life’s putting her up with. Her problems were
            not only end there but she also has to put up with the opinions or rather
            objection of Aunty Zulaikha, who takes it as her duty to even highlight
            the issue of Sister Saba using her pen name ‘Rashk-e-Hina’ other than
            her real name Saba. Baba Jan had invested a lot on me, I pleases Baba
            Jan by studying hard & isn’t like one of those spoiled boys who exploit
            the love of their parents. I always be wise & reasonable where I seemed
            well aware of the fact that all the luxuries that I demands aren’t so easily
            accessible to our family. Jameela Baji didn’t like Saba Baji ,she might get
            jealous because of the attention & the proposals Saba Baji gets, stills
            she has a very sisterly relation with her where she jokes with her, teases
            her & also listens to Saba Baji’s words of wisdom when Jameela herself
            was depressed. While Ayesha baji always supports Saba Baji and
            respect Saba Baji in all manners.

            <h1><a name="The Phuppo and His Son">The Phuppo and His Son</a></h1>
            <p>S haukat Bhai was our Phuppo’s Son and our Cousin,he didn’t
                continued his education nor did he work but always remained at home.
                She likes Saba Baji a lot, where he kept on hinting at her & still was shy
                to propose to Saba Baji directly because he’s too scared of his own
                parents.Our Phuppo was a perfect representative of all those people that
                puts a pressure on others & feel they need to restrict others of the things
                they like to do, that’s why to get what she wanted, she felt it was
                important to thrash Saba Baji’s writings in front of Baba Jan & portrayed
                us in a very bad light.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h1><a name="The Drama’s Hiring">The Drama’s Hiring</a></h1>
                <p>S aba Baji was finally on a roll where unexpectedly Rida & Sikandar
                    who’re about to produce a drama were going to approach Saba Baji
                    because Rida in particular saw the spark in her writing that she was
                    looking for. Saba Baji’s dreams was going to be true where she gets to
                    know that the famous actress Rida has read her stories & is interested in
                    working with her. Saba Baji’s knows too well that no one else would
                    support her that’s why she shares her secret with her only
                    support-system Shakeela.
                    Baba Jan and Ammi were struggling because of a bank loan they took in
                    order to purchase the house in which we were residing in. I think the
                    opportunity of Saba Baji of making some money couldn’t have presented
                    itself at any other time because right now, to see Saba Baji earning
                    some amount would obviously contribute a bit to the household
                    expenses. It was obvious that even though Ammi didn’t appreciate Saba
                    Baji’s talent & passion for writing, she had to give in because she saw
                    that she’s getting paid.Being a mother & someone who has to face all
                    sorts of social pressures, her hesitance still looks justified where she just didn’t easily allow Saba Baji to carry on with her work & resisted it as
                    much as she could.
                    Shaukat Bhai tried to contribute in Saba Baji’s life where he thinks he
                    has a right to dictate her but Saba Baji tackles him because Saba Baji
                    was more interested in pursuing her dreams rather than worrying about
                    getting married. Saba Baji was creative, strong-headed, determined &
                    passionate about what she does & for this bit.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h1><a name="Baba Jan’s Countenance">Baba Jan’s Countenance</a></h1>
                    <p>E ven though it felt us that Baba Jan wouldn’t allow Saba Baji to write
                        anymore, But ridiculously Rida Anmol was one of Baba Jan’s favourite
                        Actresses, haha, so obviously he had to agree and then everyone
                        supported Saba Baji & tried to make Baba Jan understand that this was
                        such an opportunity which shouldn’t be wasted.
                        Finally, Saba Baji got what she wanted & that was an approval of Baba
                        Jan to pursue her dream of becoming a writer. Definitely, what made
                        Baba Jan realize Saba Baji’s worth was the advance payment Sikandar
                        & Rida gave to her but keeping that aside he did understand that writing
                        was a talent as well & the credit for making Baba Jan understand
                        definitely goes to Jameela Baji.
                        Ammi was never supportive of Saba Baji but for obvious reasons, her
                        attitude changed towards her but the way she treated & rather snapped
                        Jameela Baji annoyed me a lot. Jameela Baji on her own is definitely
                        going through a hard time because she really wants to settle down &
                        have a life of her own but to see Ammi snapping at her wasn’t
                        appeasing. But Saba Baji gave Jameela Baji a save hand and supports
                        her where Jameela Baji wants..
                        
                        Saba Baji knows that it wouldn’t have been possible without the support
                        of her family so as a token of appreciation, she kept on making plans of
                        how she can utilize her money to make us feel better & happy. It
                        included small plans like changing her study table, gathering stuff for
                        Jameela Baji, changing the furniture of her house & even some big ones
                        where she dreams of having a place which she’d call as her home.
                        But yes, Saba Baji’s instinct has warned her of something about which
                        sooner or later she will have to connect the dots. Obviously, Rida Anmol
                        was kind enough to give a break to a newbie as she really was
                        impressed with her work but just because Saba Baji’s story was being
                        appreciated.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h1><a name="Rida Anmol’s Double-Cross">Rida Anmol’s Double-Cross</a></h1>
                        <p>S adly, Saba Baji’s worst nightmares have materialized because she
                            had to experience what she never thought in her dreams .Rida Anmol
                            obviously backstabbed her & took credit for her hard work. Rida Anmol &
                            Sikandar were a strong team because they’ve survived in this industry
                            for a long long time & they very well know how to mend the ways in their
                            favour.
                            It was obvious that nobody would trust in Saba Baji & because of that
                            she backed out but it was Bint-e-Hawa who guided her rightly. At that
                            time, she lost her motivation for writing.
                            Rida Anmol for sure is a conniving person & luckily she’s at the peak of
                            her success where even if she’s wrong, no one is going to question her
                            about it. Let’s just say it’s her time of glory for now but soon enough she
                            will sow what she has reaped. It was Rida Anmol who really thought that
                            writers are those people who really don’t deserve any sort of limelight
                            but now when she is projecting herself as a writer; there she is, openly
                            contradicting her own statement because she wants to get
                            acknowledged too.
                            
                            It was pretty obvious that no one would believe Saba Baji because Rida
                            Anmol certainly has a reputation in the industry & no one would want to
                            spoil their terms with her.
                            Rida Anmol knows how to play with people & their feelings, that’s why
                            she weaved a perfect trap for Saba Baji to give in. As much as Rida
                            wants to ignore the fact that Saba Baji’s talent, she actually can’t & this
                            is exactly why she tried to buy her way into her stardom again using a
                            shortcut, that she is currently enjoying due to Saba Baji’s hard work. It
                            was pretty obvious that Saba Baji wouldn’t agree to work for her but just
                            the mention of a big amount made her family rethink their feelings that
                            they had for Rida Anmol. It’s bitter but true that at times you really can’t
                            do much but have to persuade yourself to do what others want even if it
                            means leaving a dent on your soul. My studies were coming to an end
                            and I was in Internship at that time. Saba Baji realizes she was the only
                            income generator of our house, they found it as a right opportunity to
                            convince Saba Baji to take the deal that Rida offered. Finally Saba Baji
                            accepted the offer, and started again her career.

                            <p>A fter that, Shaukat Bhai proposed Saba Baji for marriage,and he
                                promised her that he would change himself & would do everything that
                                she likes but Shaukat Bahi needs to understand that it won’t be easy
                                because no matter how much he’d try, how far would be he able to push
                                himself to match her level? How much effort would he make to change
                                himself completely? He might be a good person on his own but in
                                comparison to Saba Baji, Shaukat Bhai was a lot less worthy.
                                Baba Jan also convince Saba Baji to marry Shaukat Bhai, Saba Baji was
                                not ready but Baba Jan's Rudeness let her dive in a hole. Her life is now
                                coming to curse, her future was to be a popular "Rashk-e-Hina" but time
                                changes and everything turnaround not because she agreed but,
                                because she wasn’t happy about it.</p>

                                    Phuppo is going to become a typical ‘saas’. It’s actually amusing that
                                    even though they didn’t know anything about Saba Baji & her work, they
                                    already has a problem with her just because she has earned a name for
                                    herself in a very short span of time. Phuppo and Shaukat together steal
                                    the pen and paper from Saba Baji and stopped her from writing her
                                    imagination. They treat Saba Baji like a mate and Shaukat Bhai act like a
                                    typical Husband that her wife always let her eyes down in front of him
                                    like a servant. Baba Jan and Ammi actually worried for her wellbeing
                                    more than ever. It was having hard for Saba Baji to spent her life with
                                    Shaukat Bhai. Saba baji’s miseries aren’t coming to an end. Her in laws’
                                    demands are never ending. She is supposed to do everything for them
                                    but they won’t budge. I just so wish that they hadn’t shown Shaukat Bhai
                                    as such a spineless person who has no say of his own whatsoever. He’s
                                    a typical spoiled mama’s boy who would do everything his mama tells

                                    <p>I t was Friday's morning, that Phuppa died due to heart attack, and now it
                                        was having difficult for Shaukat Bhai to let his family survive. Rida Anmol
                                        offered Saba Baji to write two more dramas for her but Shaukat stop her
                                        again.
                                        But I got a job in a firm near Model Town with an amazing package and
                                        Baba jan and Ammi was very happy and having pride that their only son
                                        for whom they spent lots of money finally got a job in a firm. After my job
                                        our home situation got better and everything was set for Ayesha baji's
                                        wedding.After a month Ammi calls Saba baji and got replied that they
                                        are having a crucial time.
                                        At that time, Shaukat Bhai realized that he was wrong, a Female can
                                        also be a support to his family. No matter what people say, a female is
                                        so strong that she can change the fate. After all Shaukat Bhai convinced
                                        Saba Baji to write to earn something for their living. Luckily she got one.
                                        As expected, Saba Baji wrote a brilliant script which made an impact
                                        right from the beginning & she secured a good place in a channel, which
                                        means Saba Baji was again on her way to success.
                                        It was good to see Saba Baji’s professional life shaping up but seems
                                        her personal life ain’t ever going to get smoother & she is going to face a
                                        lot more challenges in the days to come. Even though she proved to be
                                        a very good life partner who compromised, tried to make this marriage
                                        work & was always ready to do everything to please her new family
                                        Shaukat & his family didn’t deserve a girl like her. They all looked like a
                                        bunch of vultures when they were trying to get their hands on the money
                                        that Saba Baji earned. It’s pretty clear that they were only interested in
                                        what she can do as a writer but on the other hand they lack a basic
                                        sense of courtesy.
                                        She was a daydreamer with strong imagination, but she knows exactly
                                        when she needs to keep her eyes open & because of that she can
                                        clearly see what’s happening around her & even though it’s sad, it’s still
                                        good in a way that she is not living in some lala land, which means that if
                                        she will ever make a drastic change in her life, it won’t come across as
                                        an irrational decision.

                                        <p>S aba Baji was almost done with her in laws & especially her husband
                                            but too bad, she can’t ignore the reality because she doesn’t want to
                                            burden anyone. Even though they look Saba Baji like a victim. She has
                                            always compromised for the sake of her family’s & in-laws’s happiness.
                                            She knows how to take a stand for her, even though most of the times
                                            she has to back out from what she took a stand for, but the way she
                                            voice out her opinion & puts forth her thoughts was commendable.
                                            Saba Baji knew that leaving Shaukat Bhai’s home for a few days wasn’t
                                            a solution to her problems, but she still went ahead with it whereas if it
                                            would’ve been someone else, she couldn’t have done that.
                                            Shaukat Bhai only used all that as an alibi for his wrongdoings & what’s
                                            sad is, he still hasn’t changed, but then why would he? He knows he has
                                            his mother’s back & she is the one who allows him to do whatever he
                                            wants to but tells him to pretend because losing Saba Baji means losing
                                            all the luxuries like sugar-free biscuits, pizzas, servants & all the perks
                                            that they’re enjoying because of her. It’s ridiculous how they have
                                            exploited her & have taken her for granted but for her sake.
                                            Shaukat Bhai was a typical male blessed with a narrow-minded mentality
                                            where he still thinks he is something only because he’s a man ignoring
                                            the fact that he has achieved nothing in his life to be treated with
                                            respect.</p>

                                                considering parting ways with them, they just took it as a close call &
                                                decided to change themselves. They were still in a plus when they were
                                                at the lowest level of humanity & they still are in a plus just because of
                                                Saba Baji’s generosity & I don’t think that’s a compensation enough that
                                                just because they understood what & how much she has given to
                                                them,and now it was too much finally Saba Baji come back to our home
                                                because Shaukat Bhai and his family doesn’t deserve her. And then
                                                comes one night where Saba Baji asks Shaukat Bhai for a divorce.</p>

                                                    wasn’t with Saba Baji because she wasn’t only taking care of herself, her
                                                    kids & her in-laws – she was supporting us, siblings as well.I have been
                                                    blessed with such an amazing & selfless sister.
                                                    I loved the way how much Saba Baji had done for each & everyone &
                                                    how the time was right to pay her back by at least understanding &
                                                    supporting her.
                                                    Time shift to 8 years later, Alhumdulillah I am doing my own business
                                                    now and now our family is wealthy. Saba Baji now has a son called
                                                    Fahad as well. Saba Baji has become a well-known Drama writer.
                                                    I just want to say, there is no limit for Dreams and everyone has the right
                                                    to achieve them. How a woman sacrifices herself for the sake of its
                                                    family and relations only God knows. In the end we all should have to
                                                    respect women and appreciate them in every part of life because she is
                                                    the only one that can change the generation of generations.</p>
