        <h2>Top 10 plant care tips</h2>
        <h4>
          Taking care of plants can be tricky. You need to consider multiple variables, such as lighting and watering. Here’s the good news: Ambius is the expert in plant care and will ensure the plants at your property receive the attention they need. Contact us to learn more about how we can design beautiful arrangements that enhance the environment of your space.

          In the meantime, read about top plant care tips to get on the right track.
          <ol>
            <li class="data1">
              Avoid annoying little flies by being careful not to tip tea and coffee into plant containers. The sugars left in the compost make it an ideal breeding ground for sciarid flies. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">
              Use trough planters as natural screens. They reduce noise and are useful as barriers to separate walkways etc. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">
              One of the most common causes of plant death is over-watering. If in doubt, leave it to Ambius, the experts! 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">
              Your plants need water, light and warmth to survive. So when you're off on vacation, don't forget about your green friends. Make sure that someone else knows to keep the blinds open and the thermostat up. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">
              Peat free compost is suitable for all your indoor plants. Contact us for an excellent peat free alternative. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">
              Variegated plants (featuring leaves with white edges or white flecks) often need more light than their green cousins. Keep them nearer to a window so that they can get all the light that they need. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">Plants acclimatise slowly to different surroundings by changing their leaf orientation and structure. If you can, try not to move them around, as they may not adapt as easily as you think. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">Plants reduce stress. Learn more here about benefits of plants. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">You can still have plants where space is at a premium. Some of the latest designs use tall containers to show off the plants, whilst taking up as little floor space as possible. 
            </li>
            <li class="data1">Regularly prune your plants to stop them becoming 'leggy'. Once they've lost the foliage on their lower branches, it's very difficult to get it to return.</li>

        <h2>Top Three Plant Care Tips</h2>
        <h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Choose Plants Based on Light in your Space
              <ol class="data2">Are the plants you love the ones you can have? The​ available light in your space will help you decide. Check the direction your windows are facing; south-facing windows give bright light, east/west-facing windows give moderate light and north-facing windows give low light. Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect sunlight.

                If the sun is intense through your windows, add a lovely sheer curtain to diffuse the light. Cacti and some succulents like aloe can of course handle brighter, direct sunlight. You don’t want to overexpose or underexpose any plant. They need the right amount of light to live.</ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure Out Your Plant Compatibility
              <ol class="data2">
                New to plant parenthood? A busy ​work schedule, social​ ​life and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect. It’s okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle. A jetsetter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low-maintenance succulents, ZZ plants or snake plants, all pretty low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively). These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.

If you’ve got more time, you can try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids or ferns. Like a mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for these delicate plants.
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              ​Less (Water) Is More
              <ol class="data2">
                It’s better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your water schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.

How often you water will also change throughout the year. Plants need less water in the winter, when they’re growing slower, the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense. If the heat is on and the soil is drying quicker, they may need a bit more water. Wilting leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the sides of the planter are signs of a thirsty plant.

Always use warm water because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their roots. The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants, who need water on their leaves as well.

Place a saucer under your planter. When you water, let it soak in for a few hours, then toss any water that’s left on the saucer. If no water is left over, give the soil another soak.
